            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Our game, Cleaning the City, is based around Smarter and Future Cities. It is supposed to show the many problems that arise in large cities that are yet to be resolved, and how some work (and in the real world, help from friends), can fix these problems. Some of the problems that are presented are littering, and the condition of roadways, sidewalks, and buildings. The game is made in a series of four levels, each with the instructions being given by the narrator. The first level requires the player to pick up all 45 pieces of recyclable and garbage material by simply clicking on each piece. The second level requires the player to organize the garbage or recyclable materials into the appropriate bin. Once this is done, the player moves onto the third level where he or she patches up potholes and cracks that were caused by erosion of roadways and sidewalks. Once the player patches the potholes and cracks, he or she has to press the done button. The fourth and final level requires the player to replace and fill in the missing bricks in the surrounding buildings, and once done to then press the done button to finish the fourth level and the game.</p>
